# Simon-game
This is an interactive Simon Game that simulates the classic Simon Electronic Memory Game.

This game is a UI-based project that I created for fun.😜
All of the functionalities, such as button click, button animation, sound play, light flicker, background change, level change, and so on, have been written entirely in JavaScript.

## Built with 🛠️

## Game Rule
Each level will have a different order of button blink, the player must follow the order of button blink and click the corresponding button.
If all of the buttons are correctly pressed, the player advances to the next level.
